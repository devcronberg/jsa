### Hello world

This is a very simple assignment. Make sure index.html has a 
reference to `scripts/starter/005helloworld.js` and use
 console.log to write "hello from me" to the console. See
 if it works by typing "npm start" in console (ask the instrutor), and press F12 in the browser to see 
   the console-window.

This is a perfect time to discuss

* "Getting started"
* Best practice javascript
* Debug
* Node
* NPM (scripts)
* Why use Chrome/Firefox/Edge
* Linter (ESLint)
* browser-sync
* Transpiler
